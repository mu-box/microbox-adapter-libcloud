# microbox-adapter-libcloud
A Microbox cloud provider adapter to integrate with multiple cloud providers

## Required evars
In order to grab catalog data without a user's cedentials (for generic pricing
estimates, for example), default credentials are required for each supported
provider. These creds will never be used to actually create/manage actual VMs,
as the internal logic will never even look them up outside of the one scenario
where catalog data is being generated for generic use. Still, it's a lot of
variables to set, so they'll all be listed below, to ensure they all get added
in. Since there are non-auth evars required as well, the sensitive ones are
marked, below, with an asterisk (\*).

_Please keep this list sorted alphabetically by provider name to help with
finding evars quickly._
